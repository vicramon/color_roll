# ColorRoll Piano Notation

ColorRoll is an alternative way to visualize a piece of music for piano that's designed
to be easier to read than sheet music. It's kind of like Guitar Tabs, but for piano.

### TODOs

- time signature, tempo information
- make arrow keys skip "pages".
- ability to play a measure in the browser
- more distinct endings of notes when there are two long ones next to each other
- printable version

### Contributing

I will gladly accept improvements via pull request! I know there's a lot of potential for 
new feature and enhancements.

If you're attempting a big change, please raise an issue first and let's discuss.

My main care is that I want to keep the UI clean, functional, and fast.
