# ColorRoll Piano Notation

### What is it?

ColorRoll is like Guitar Tabs but for piano â€“ it's an easy way to visualize a piece of music, so that
you can play it easier.

### TODOs

- time signature, tempo information
- make arrow keys skip "pages".
- ability to play a measure in the browser
- more distinct endings of notes when there are two long ones next to each other
- printable version
